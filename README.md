Scripts used for pacbio amplicon analysis

The scripts here were used for processing Pacbio amplicon data for the project "Deep Mutational Scanning of Phenotype Arrays" - Manuscript under preparation. 

NOTE: I wrote these scripts while learning to use Matlab from scratch. Most of the variables are hard-coded (sorry!). Pretty much my "Hello World". As such, code will be (mostly) functional but poor in most cases. At some point, I hope to comeback and do a better job of rewriting & commenting this code that is actually useful to someone else.
